0x0A. Python - Inheritance
 In Python, inheritance is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called the "subclass" or "derived class") to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called the "base class" or "parent class"). This enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of code.
